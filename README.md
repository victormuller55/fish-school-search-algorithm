Fish School Search Algorithm (FSS)

This is a Java project for the Fish School Search (FSS) algorithm. FSS is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of schools of fish in nature. It operates based on the observation of the cooperative behavior of fish in the search for food.

How does the algorithm work?

The FSS algorithm is an optimization technique that models the movement and interaction of fish in search of an optimal solution. It utilizes concepts of individual and collective movement, along with social learning strategies, to explore the search space for the best possible solution.

Project Features:

Implementation of the FSS algorithm in Java
User-friendly interface for parameter configuration and result visualization
Detailed documentation on the algorithm and its implementation
Usage examples and unit tests
